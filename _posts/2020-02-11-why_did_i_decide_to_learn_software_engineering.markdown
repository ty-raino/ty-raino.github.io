I've decided to learn Software Engineering because I wanted to try something new. I came across an app called Grasshopper from playing a mobile game and I thought it was really interesting. As I started working on tutorials and assignments, I started to dive in a little deeper. I found about Career Karma, Codecademy, Flatiron Bootcamp Prep, and a few other sites to show me the basics of coding.

At the time of learning, I was working a full-time job. I really wanted to join a bootcamp so I can expand my knowledge in coding, but I didn't know how to fit it into my schedule. I became so overwhelmed that I just decided to stop everything. I felt really sad because of it, but I needed to work a job to continue getting funds. After 3 or 4 months, I decided to quit my job, get back into coding, and apply for bootcamps. Flatiron gave me the opportunity to join the bootcamp and now here I am! Starting on March 3rd!

I am a audio engineer, live sound engineer, music producer, and photographer. I would love to add software engineering to the list!
