Finally finished my CLI project after 2 weeks and I have to say.. it was extremely rough. 

I've bought my first guitar so I've decided to make a CLI program based on guitar browsing. I was excited to put my knowledge to the test, but also VERY nervous since I did start my project late. First, I wanted to use API, but couldn't find anything based on what I wanted to do, so I decided to scrape instead. The website I initially wanted to use was Guitar Center, but their page was blocked for scraping, so I went over to Reverb.com. I was planning on getting maybe about 5 categories, but I thought that was a little too much so I went with 3; Electric, Acoustic, and Bass.

Started scraping, getting all the information I needed, had to do TONS of changes. I wanted to use one method for the 3 categories to keep it short and simple since they had the same html, but that wasn't going to work out so I had to do 3 seperate methods for each category. After some time, they had updated their website and the html was different and now I couldn't get information for the Bass category, so I had to stick with electric and acoustic. 

I wanted to get the price and description of a guitar, but the website stored them in inconsistent places so I've decided to hard-code (yes, I know), just to make my CLI more better for the user. I've spent a lot of time getting the price and description of EVERY guitar to later find out doing that isn't a good idea for the project, so I had to try and get everything that I can. I was HIGHLY disappointed because I had wasted so much time getting the information. So I was left with just a basic CLI showing the top 5 most popular electric and acoustic guitars that's listed on the website. 

I was HIGHLY upset because I wanted this project to show prices, descriptions, and more! I wanted the user to interact with it A LOT more than what it is now. I didn't want to start completely over because I came too far and there wasn't enough time. I've spent 2 weeks just hitting tons of brick walls with a project that could've took maybe 3 days.

On the bright side, I've learned a lot. I've learned about parsing data, objects, class methods, user inputs, gems, and environments. I had tons of help from my cohort lead and honestly, if I didn't have that, I probably would've been stuck.
Even though the app turned out very short and simple, I'm proud that I've managed to stick through and not give up. This was a test to see if I could do it and guess what? I did it! This is a huge milestone for me and I'm ready to start the next chapter in my coding journey. ![ ](https://imgur.com/kjsaeIa)
